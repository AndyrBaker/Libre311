# Customizing

WeMove is currently designed as a LocalMotion application. However, various parts of the UI can be customized to fit in line with your own organization.

## Background

The image used in the background of the app is located in `/frontend/src/lib/backgroundImage.jpg`. If you want to change the background image, remove the current `backgroundImage.jpg`, and put a new image in this directory in it's place (remember to rename the new file to `backgroundImage.jpg`).

## Footer

The footer of the app currently displays links to various pages from LocalMotion, as well as their social media links.
